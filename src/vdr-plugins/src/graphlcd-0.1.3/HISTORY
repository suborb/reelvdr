VDR Plugin 'graphlcd' Revision History
-------------------------------------

2006-01-15: Version 0.1.3
- Don't replace newlines with spaces in text items any longer.
- Rewritten cGraphLCDDisplay::WrapText(). It is much faster now.
- Increased time to wait for display task to start (thanks to Andreas
  Brachold).
- Explicitly set the current channel to prevent a crash if no channel logo was
  set (thanks to Andreas Brachold).
- Added support for VDR version 1.3.38 and up (thanks to Andreas Brachold).
- Added logos for cable and terrestrial channels and modified some of the old
  (thanks to Stefan Hußfeldt).


2005-09-17: Version 0.1.2
- split off drivers to GraphLCD base package (libglcddrivers)
- split off graphics and font handling to GraphLCD base package
  (libglcdgraphics)
- split off tools to GraphLCD base package
- adopted the plugin's code to use the new driver and graphics API
- removed low level driver settings from the plugin's setup page. They
  are now located in the driver lirbrary's configuration file.
- display class: grouped current state values into some structures
- using a mutex for exclusive access on current state values
- moved current vdr state structures to new class cGraphLCDState based
  on old cGraphLCDStatus class.
- completely rewritten logo list implementation
- further code revising
- added channel IDs for logonames.alias.1.3 for the DVB-T channels in Berlin
  and probably other areas in Germany (thanks to Andreas Brachold)
- now compiles with gcc 2.95 and 3.x
- added missing #includes
- made the plugin more thread-safe by making the global state variable
  a member of the display class and correcting the initialization order.
- added possibility to switch on backlight at user activity and switch it off
  at user inactivity (thanks to Andreas Brachold). Can be enabled or disabled
  in setup menu.
- added additional space between progress bar and logo on small LCDs (thanks
  to Andreas Brachold).
- added loopmode display in mp3 replay mode (thanks to Wolfgang Fritz).
- replaced usleep with cCondWait::SleepMs() for vdr version 1.3.14 or greater
- adapted to changes in vdr 1.3.18
- now using verdana fonts converted by genfont as default for large displays.
- moved plugin initialisation to cPluginGraphLCD::Initialize and added a wait
  for the start of the display thread to cPluginGraphLCD::Start to don't miss
  first channel switch (thanks to wofritz from vdrportal.de)
- added rumanian translations (thanks to Lucian Muresan)
- Added support for Freetype2 fonts based on the patch by Lucian Muresan.
-- the fonts used by the plugin are no longer specified through symbolic
   links to the font files but in a config file named fonts.conf that is
   located in the graphlcd config directory (where logonames.alias is)
-- the entries in the fonts.conf file are defined in a URL like way, a prefix
   gives the type of the font and a absolute or relative path gives the
   font file, plus the size in case of freetype2
-- I provided several sample fonts.conf files as a replacement for the old
   symbolic links
- Fixed length of timebar in case event lasts longer.
- Added a patch for VDR 1.3.29 and up that adds a new method Tick() to the
  cStatus class. This method is called from vdr's main task every second. The
  patch should apply to older versions too, maybe small changes are needed.
- Now querying the replay state in the cStatus::Tick() method if available.
- Now loading config file in cPluginGraphLCD::Initialize and not in
  ProcessArgs. So it is possible to view the help page without specifying
  config file and display.
- Rearranged includes to prevent an compiler error regardings the swap
  function.
- Added a check for EIT scanner activity in cGraphLCDState::ChannelSwitch
  function to prevent showing channel logos during replay.
- Added a check for file extension in replay type identification (thanks to
  Andreas Brachold).
- Added channel logos for Radio Eins (thanks to Andreas Brachold).



2004-09-26: Version 0.1.1
- fixed vdr 1.2 service id compile error
- fixed t6963 driver: added range check in Set8Pixels, now all sizes should
  work
- new driver: gu256x64-3900, should support other sizes too (thanks to
  Ralf Müller)
- Added, replaced and removed some channel logos (thanks to Marco Birkholz)
- Now using a channels unique channel ID (without Source, VDR-1.3) or service
  ID (VDR 1.2) instead of channel names to identify the channel logo.
-- During this I have renamed almost all channel logos so it is needed to
   replace your old /<vdr config directory>/plugins/graphlcd/ completely.
-- There are now two logonames.alias files, one for vdr 1.2 and the other one
   for vdr 1.3, you maybe have to recreate the link, p. e.
   "ln -sf logonames.alias.1.3 logonames.alias" if you have a vdr 1.3 version.

   menu

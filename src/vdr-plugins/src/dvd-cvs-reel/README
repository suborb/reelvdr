Requirements:
-------------

vdr >= 1.3.25		http://cadsoft.de/vdr/, ftp://ftp.cadsoft.de/vdr/Developer/
libdvdcss >= 20030724	http://www.videolan.org/libdvdcss/download.html
libdvdnav >= 0.1.10	http://dvd.sf.net
a52dec >= 0.7.4		http://liba52.sourceforge.net/

The plugin has been tested with the following versions:

libdvdcss:	20030724 (cvs)
libdvdnav:	0.1.10
liba52:		0.7.4

+++

libdvdcss is optional, but required for playing CSS protected DVDs.
The libraries should be installed into /usr/lib, e.g.:

   # ./configure --prefix=/usr
   # make
   # make install

But be aware to check your countries law, for example, nowadays
it is prohibited in europe to workaround a _copy_protection_ - so just don't copy ;-)

Accessing the DVD drive:
------------------------

The plugin uses libdvdcss to access CSS protected DVDs. Older version on
the library worked best with DVDCSS_METHODE set. Newer versions no longer
require.

Note that the user id under which VDR runs needs to have write access to
the DVD device in order to replay CSS protected DVDs.

By default VDR expects the DVD drive to be located at /dev/dvd (which
typically is a symbolic link to the actual device, for instance /dev/hdc).
You can use the '-C' option to overwrite this, as in

  vdr -P"dvd -C/media/dvd"

Navigation in DVD mode:
-----------------------

The following navigation keys are available in DVD mode:

Key            Function
-------------------------------------------------------------
Red            Goto position (enter time)
Green          1 min. backward
Yellow         1 min. forward
Blue           Goto title (enter title number)

Back           Stop Replay - Exit

Ok             toggle progess display (this will mess up any subtitles)

Up,   kPlay    playback
Down, kPause   pauses playback

Left/Right     rewind/forward (fast if play mode, slow if pause mode)
kFastRew/kFastFwd

Audio          select audio track

2              skip to next     subtitle ( if "no subtitle" is reached, progress display on, 
                                           if subtitle language code is prefixed with "forced-" 
					   (eg. 'forced-en') only forced subs will be shown )
3              skip to next     angle    (skip copyright notice)

4              skip to previous chapter
6              skip to next     chapter
7, kChanDn     skip to previous title
9, kChanUp     skip to next     title

5              DvdNavigationForce ON / go to DVD Root menu (if progess display on)
8              go to DVD Title menu
0              go to DVD Audio menu      (only avaiable if progess display off)

In DVD-Menu:
2/8/4/6,5      DVD menu Up/Down/Left/Right, OK control's
               Left/Right/Up/Down OK also work when in menuspace
	       Red 	      Leave DvdNavigationForce
	       Green          skip to previous title
	       Yellow         skip to next     title
	       Goto title (enter title number)
	       
Notes:
=======

if you use next/prev title, and you are e.g. jumping from title 3
to title 13, then this is not a bug, but a feature of the author 
of the current DVD !

so you can use Goto title, to manually check a specific one ..
this way enables you to look at "hidden" titles ;-)

HowTo play DVD games ..
------------------------

Assume you have a typical DVD game, 
so you need to enter/force DVD Navigation mode !

	- Key 5  	DvdNavigationForce ON (not if progess display on)
	- Key Red  	Leave DvdNavigationForce


BUG:
====
if you have subtitles enabled by setup, or by key, the osd / progress display,
may disappear, but believes it is still visible ..
so just press OK one more time to make it hide for real.
